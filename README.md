Required:

- [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Refer to `.env` for required keys.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vasemkin/dex.git
$ cd dex

# install dependancies
$ yarn
$ yarn chain
```

The chain is now running at `http://localhost:8545`!
The contracts are deployed automatically.
This network is reffered to as localhost.
Open the source code and start editing!

Make sure your Metamask chainId is 31337. It is 1337 by default.

## Testing

```bash
$ yarn typechain
$ yarn test
```

The tests are run on the hardhat network. It is different from localhost.

## Deployment

```
$ yarn deploy:testnet
```

This code is not audited. It is not recommended to deploy to mainnet.
